## Overview

Rokt integrates with Google Tag Manager, enabling partners to set attributes and launch placements through Google's tag management system. This template allows for the configuration and loading of the mParticle by Rokt SDK on your site, helping to pre-load and improve the performance of the SDK integration.

Partners can configure their tags on [Google's Console](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/?page=1) instead of managing the Rokt script directly.

## Custom Event and Screen View Templates 
The custom event template allows you to configure and log an [mParticle Custom Event](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/event-tracking/#custom-events). The mParticle SDK must be initialized prior to this GTM tag firing for the event to be logged appropriately. 

### Steps to enable: 
1. Select the Tag Template from the [Google Community Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/?page=1) or import the .tpl file to your GTM workspace. 
2. Configure the tag including any desired custom attributes or flags. 
3. Configure the tag's trigger. 
4. Deploy the tag.

This is a public repository containing the TPL file necessary for Google to support Rokt's application onto the Tag Manager Marketplace.

To use on an adhoc basis -- please download the .tpl file and upload this in your Google Tag Manager Template interface. You can read more about how to do that [here](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates).
